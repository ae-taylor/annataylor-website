							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Originally from Texas and now living life on the East Coast, I've spent the last year learning how to develop thoughtful, intuitive products and features. 
								I began my career in the human services field - first, as a case manager, and then as a middle school English Teacher. 
								Through this work, I discovered a love for creative problem solving and making data-driven decisions to help clients and students reach their goals. 
								After diving into coding as a hobby, I decided I wanted to share my skills in a more technical role. 
								</p>
								<p>Prior to attending Rithm School, I graduated from West Texas A&M University with a degree in Psychology. While there, I studied research methodologies,
								the psychology of learning, and volunteered as a research assistant in our psychology lab.</p>
								<p>When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me watching sports, playing video games, or hanging out with my cat, Lola. </p>

									<li><a href="#two" class="button scrolly">Here are some things I've built</a></li>

							<h2>Student Information System (SIS)</h2>
							<p>SIS is an administrative student information system app built for staff to manage curriculum at Rithm School and students to obtain important course updates daily. 
								It is built with a Django and PostgreSQL backend. As an intern, I helped build key administrative features on the backend for staff to use and implemented fixes for 
								urgent issues.</p>
								<p>I implemented time saving navigation features, including a way for lectures and exercises to be separated into 
									recent/upcoming so that students and staff could easily refer back to recent sessions or jump to the current session on the page. 
									I fixed a bug that was allowing students to submit assessments after the assessment close date in certain situations, 
									and added tests for each feature/fix implemented.

							<h2>Warbler</h2>
							<p>Warbler is a serverside Twitter clone utilizing Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja templating, jQuery, and Axios. 
								My main roles were to fix bugs in the user profile, logout, and homepage routes, add profile editing functionality, and add the ability to like a Warble(tweet). 
								I also added testing, including model and view unit tests. This project gave me the opportunity to integrate code into a larger, existing codebase and maintain 
								testing coverage with features added.</p>

							<h2>Jobly</h2>
							<p>Jobly is a full stack app that lists companies and jobs, and allows users to search for new jobs. It uses Node/Express with PostgreSQL on the backend and React on the frontend.
								Users can register/login with their account credentials. Logged in users can browse and filter companies and view jobs to apply for.
								I used test driven development (TDD) on the backend and had the opportunity to design a detailed component hierarchy on the frontend.</p>

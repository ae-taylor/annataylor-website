							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Originally from Texas and now living life on the East Coast, 
								I made a career pivot to software engineering in 2020. 
								I began my career in the human services field - 
								first, as a case manager, and then as a middle 
								school English Teacher. Through this work, I discovered
								 a love for creative problem solving and making data-driven 
								 decisions to help clients and students reach their goals. 
								After diving into coding as a hobby, 
								I decided I wanted to share my skills in a more technical role. 
								</p>
								<p>Prior to my career change, I graduated from 
									West Texas A&M University with a degree in 
									Psychology. While there, I studied research 
									methodologies, the psychology of learning, 
									and volunteered as a research assistant in 
									our psychology lab.</p>
								<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me watching 
									sports, playing video games, or painting (badly). </p>

							<h2>Student Information System (SIS)</h2>
							<p>SIS is an administrative student information system app
								 built for staff to manage curriculum at Rithm School 
								 and students to obtain important course updates daily. 
								It is built with a Django and PostgreSQL backend. 
								As an engineer at Rithm School, I helped build key 
								administrative features on the backend for staff to use. I  
								implemented fixes for urgent issues, and maintained 
								95-100% test coverage of the codebase.</p>

							<h2>Warbler</h2>
							<p>Warbler is a serverside Twitter clone utilizing 
								Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja templating,
								 jQuery, and Axios. 
								My main roles were to fix bugs in the user profile,
								 logout, and homepage routes, add profile editing
								  functionality, and add the ability to like a 
								  Warble(tweet). 
								I also added testing, including model and view 
								unit tests. This project gave me the opportunity 
								to integrate code into a larger, existing 
								codebase and maintain testing coverage with 
								features added.</p>

							<h2>Jobly</h2>
							<p>Jobly is a full stack app that lists companies 
								and jobs, and allows users to search for new 
								jobs. It uses Node/Express with PostgreSQL on 
								the backend and React on the frontend. Users can 
								register/login with their account credentials. 
								Logged in users can browse and filter companies 
								and view jobs to apply for. I used test driven 
								development (TDD) on the backend and had the 
								opportunity to design a detailed component 
								hierarchy on the frontend.</p>
